# Chat-Room

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App

It's a chat-room where multiple users can login chat with each other.

For the API part I have used Chat Engine which makes it easy to build chat services.

ChatEngine:-https://chatengine.io/

Note:-As of now I have only create 3 users to login. This is not fully deployed server chat app. That's why I had to manually enter the users.

Here the credentials-

1.username:-"18Adrian" || password:-"123123"

2.username:-"zackzimmer" || password:-"123123"

3.username:-"guest" || password:-"123123"
